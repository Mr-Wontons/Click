As of right now you're just gonna have to put it in a coding editor like VSCode and host with a live server.
If anyone can help me with setting up an official site I'd really appreciate it.
I know how inefficient this code is, I just started learning all these coding/programming languages so any help with efficiency would be greatly appreciated as well
That's about it for this ReadMe, if there's anything else I should add here, or anything you want in game let me know
Thanks for checking this place out at least really appreciate the suppor
